# Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is a crucial part of the data preprocessing step in machine learning. It involves transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying patterns to improve model accuracy.

### 1. Understanding Features

**Feature**: A variable or column in your dataset that helps in predicting the target. For instance, in a house price prediction dataset, features could be the number of rooms, area in square feet, etc.

**Target**: The output or label you are trying to predict. In the house price example, the target is the price
