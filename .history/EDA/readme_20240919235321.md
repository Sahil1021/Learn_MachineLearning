# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is an essential step in the data analysis pipeline. It helps you understand the structure, patterns, and anomalies in your data before diving into feature engineering or modeling. Let’s cover it in a way that you can teach others.

### 1. What is EDA?

EDA is the process of summarizing and visualizing your dataset to gain insights. It’s about exploring the data's underlying structure, detecting patterns, spotting anomalies, testing hypotheses, and checking assumptions.

### Steps in EDA Workflow

EDA typically involves five key steps:

1. Loading the Data: Reading the data into a manageable format.

2. Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing the data using statistics.

3. Data Visualization: Plotting the data to understand its distribution and relationships.

4. Outlier Detection: Identifying unusual values that could skew analysis.
5. Correlation Analysis: Checking relationships between variables.
